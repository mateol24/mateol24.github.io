                    <h1>Who Am I? </h1>
					<p>I am Mateo Lamnije from Albania currently studying at LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania. I am in my last year of studies in Intenrational Business Administration. I have dedicated most of my free time during my university studies to learn more about the capital markets and more specifically investment banking, financial modeling, and investments in general. As a student at a Liberal Arts university, I strongly believe that having knowledge from different fields can help anyone become a better investor and that is why I try to read and learn as much as I can about politics, technology, science, and of course finance. During university studies, I have been able to develop outstanding critical thinking, analytical, and research skills. As I started taking online courses and reading more extracurricular books my day became way busier, in this way, I learned how to prioritize and manage my time at my best which I find important in todayâ€™s world where distractions are everywhere.<p>

					<p> Since at a very young age I have been involved in voluntary work with a local NGO in my hometown. I worked there for about 5-6 years and then I moved for studies to Lithuania. During my time at this NGO I learned to perform many duties. I got involved in organizing First Aid trainings for students of elementary and high schools in Albania, organized summer camps with other volunteers for children with and social and economic problems, performed medical visits in remote areas in northern Albania, and contributed on aid delivery during emergency situations around Albania. In addition, I participated in different projects outside Albania, projects mostly funded by Erasmus+. This has given  me the opportunity to travel around Europe and learn about new cultures and gained experience in team work and project management. <br> When I have free time from studies I like to spend it in productive and reflective ways by reading, watching documentaries, learning new things, walking, and dedicating some time to friends. I am really passionate about Finance and business world in general. Learning more about financial modeling and its other financial components takes most of my time.<br><br>For more, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateolamnije/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile!</p>
